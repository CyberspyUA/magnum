       to a cache-global glyph ID with far less overhead than a hashmap would,
       and much less memory used as well compared to storing a key, value and a
       hash for each mapping entry.

       Another assumption is that there's no more than 64k glyphs in total,
       which makes the mapping save half memory compared to storing 32-bit
       ints. 64K glyphs is enough to fill a 4K texture with 16x16 glyphs, which
       seems enough for now. It however might get reached at some point in
       practice, in which case the type would simply get changed to a 32-bit
       one (and the assertion in addGlyph() then removed). */
