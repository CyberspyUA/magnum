@brief Render glyph positions for a (part of a) single line
@param[in] font             Font to query metrics from
@param[in] size             Size to render the glyphs at
@param[in] direction        Layout direction. Currently expected to always be
    @ref LayoutDirection::HorizontalTopToBottom.
@param[in] glyphOffsets     Glyph offsets coming from @ref AbstractShaper
    instance(s) associated with @p font
@param[in] glyphAdvances    Glyph advances coming from @ref AbstractShaper
    instance(s) associated with @p font
@param[in,out] cursor       Initial cursor position. Is updated to a final
    cursor position after all glyphs are rendered.
@param[out] glyphPositions  Where to put output absolute glyph positions
@return Rectangle spanning the rendered cursor range in one direction and font
    descent to ascent in the other
@m_since_latest

The output of this function are just glyph positions alone, which is useful for
example when the actual glyph quad expansion is done by a shader or when the
glyphs get subsequently rasterized some other way than applying a glyph texture
to a sequence of quads. Use @ref renderGlyphQuadsInto() on the resulting
@p glyphPositions array to form actual glyph quads together with texture
coordinates.

The @p glyphOffsets, @p glyphAdvances and @p glyphPositions views are all
expected to have the same size. It's possible to use the same view for
@p glyphOffsets and @p glyphPositions, which will turn the input relative glyph
offsets into absolute positions.

Calls to this function don't strictly need to match calls to
@ref AbstractShaper::shape(). For example if multiple text runs on a single
line differ just by script, language or direction but not by a font or
rendering size, they can be shaped into consecutive portions of a larger
@p glyphOffsets and @p glyphAdvances array and this function can be then called
just once for all runs together. If the font or rendering size changes between
text runs however, you have to call this function for each such run separately
and each time use the updated @p cursor value as an input for the next
@ref renderLineGlyphPositionsInto() call.

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
    This function only works on a single line of text. When rendering a
    multi-line text, you have to split it by lines and then shape, render and
    align each individually, and adjust @p cursor for each new line as
    appropriate.

Once the whole line is rendered, @ref Math::join() the rectangles returned from
all calls to this function and pass them together with positions for the whole
line to @ref alignRenderedLine(). Finally, to align a multi-line block, join
rectangles returned from all @ref alignRenderedLine() calls and pass them
together with positions for the whole text to @ref alignRenderedBlock().

Produces a sequence of quad corner positions and texture coordinates in order
as shown below. The @p glyphPositions and @p glyphIds views are expected to
have the same size, the @p vertexPositions and @p vertexTextureCoordinates
views are then expected to be four times larger than @p glyphPositions and
@p glyphIds, in order to ultimately contain four corner vertices for each
glyph. To optimize memory use, it's possible to alias @p glyphPositions with
@cpp vertexPositions.every(4) @ce and @p glyphIds with
@cpp vertexTextureCoordinates.every(4) @ce. The @p vertexTextureCoordinates are
temporarily used to store resolved cache-global glyph IDs, the rendering is
then performed in a way that first reads the position and ID for each glyph and
only then fills in the vertex data.

If the text doesn't need to be aligned based on the actual glyph bounds (i.e.,
the desired @ref Alignment isn't `*GlyphBounds`), it's  possible to call this
function even on a multi-line text run provided that @ref alignRenderedLine()
was called on the @p glyphPositions before to align lines relatively to each
other. Otherwise this function should be called on each line individually and
then the @p vertexPositions passed further to @ref alignRenderedLine().

Expects that @p font is contained in @p cache. Glyph IDs not found in the cache
are replaced with the cache-global invalid glyph. If the @p cache is only 2D,
you can use the @ref renderGlyphQuadsInto(const AbstractFont&, Float, const AbstractGlyphCache&, const Containers::StridedArrayView1D<const Vector2>&, const Containers::StridedArrayView1D<const UnsignedInt>&, const Containers::StridedArrayView1D<Vector2>&, const Containers::StridedArrayView1D<Vector2>&)

@ref renderGlyphQuadIndicesInto() to populate the corresponding index array.

positions in the text passed to @ref AbstractShaper::shape() for which the

given range. Assumes that @p clusters are either monotonically non-decreasing
or non-increasing.

If @p clusters are empty or @p end is less or equal to all @p clusters, returns
@cpp {0, 0} @ce. If @p begin is greater than all @p clusters are, both return
values are set to @p clusters size. In both cases the empty returned range
means there are no glyphs corresponding to given byte. Otherwise, if the input
range is non-empty, the returned range is always at least one glyph. The
returned range always points to cluster boundaries, even if the input is inside
a multi-byte character or ligature or inside a multi-glyph cluster.

If @p begin is greater than @p end, the first value of the output is also
greater than the second. Otherwise, the first value of the output is always
less than or equal to the second.

At the moment, the lookup is done with an @f$ \mathcal{O}(n) @f$ complexity,

/**
@brief OpenGL text renderer

Lays out the text into mesh using given font. Use of ligatures, kerning etc.
depends on features supported by particular font and its layouter.

@section Text-BasicRenderer-usage Usage

Immutable text (e.g. menu items, credits) can be simply rendered using static
methods, returning result either as data arrays or as fully configured mesh.
The text can be then drawn as usual by configuring the shader and drawing the
mesh:

@snippet Text-gl.cpp BasicRenderer-usage1

See @ref render(AbstractFont&, const AbstractGlyphCache&, Float, const std::string&, Alignment)
and @ref render(AbstractFont&, const AbstractGlyphCache&, Float, const std::string&, GL::Buffer&, GL::Buffer&, GL::BufferUsage, Alignment)
for more information.

While this method is sufficient for one-shot rendering of static texts, for
mutable texts (e.g. FPS counters, chat messages) there is another approach

@subsection Text-BasicRenderer-usage-font-size Font size

As mentioned in @ref Text-AbstractFont-font-size "AbstractFont class documentation",
the size at which the font is loaded is decoupled from the size at which a
concrete text is rendered. In particular, with a concrete projection matrix,
the size you pass to either @ref render() or to the @ref BasicRenderer()
constructor will always result in the same size of the rendered text,
independently of the size the font was loaded in. Size of the loaded font is
the size at which the glyphs get prerendered into the glyph cache, affecting
visual quality.

When rendering the text, there are two common approaches --- either setting up
the size to match a global user interface scale, or having the text size
proportional to the window size. The first approach results in e.g. a 12 pt
font matching a 12 pt font in other applications, and is what's shown in the
above snippets. The most straightforward way to achieve that is to set up the
projection matrix size to match actual window pixels, such as @ref Platform::Sdl2Application::windowSize() "Platform::*Application::windowSize()".
If using the regular @ref GlyphCacheGL, for best visual quality it should be
created with the @ref AbstractFont loaded at the same size as the text to be
rendered, although often a double supersampling achieves a crisper result.
I.e., loading the font with 24 pt, but rendering with 12 pt. See below for
@ref Text-BasicRenderer-usage-font-size-dpi "additional considerations for proper DPI awareness".

The second approach, with text size being relative to the window size, is for
cases where the text is meant to match surrounding art, such as in a game menu.
In this case the projection size is usually something arbitrary that doesn't
match window pixels, and the text point size then has to be relative to that.
For this use case a @ref DistanceFieldGlyphCacheGL is the better match, as it
can provide text at different sizes with minimal quality loss. See its
documentation for details about picking the right font size and other
parameters for best results.

@subsection Text-BasicRenderer-usage-font-size-dpi DPI awareness

To achieve crisp rendering and/or text size matching other applications on
HiDPI displays, additional steps need to be taken. There are two separate
concepts for DPI-aware rendering:

-   Interface size --- size at which the interface elements are positioned on
    the screen. Often, for simplicity, the interface is using some "virtual
    units", so a 12 pt font is still a 12 pt font independently of how the
    interface is scaled compared to actual display properties (for example by
    setting a global 150% scale in the desktop environment, or by zooming a
    browser window). The size used by the @ref BasicRenderer "Renderer*D"
    should match these virtual units.
-   Framebuffer size --- how many pixels is actually there. If a 192 DPI
    display has a 200% interface scale, a 12 pt font would be 32 pixels. But if
    it only has a 150% scale, all interface elements will be smaller, and a 12
    pt font would be only 24 pixels. The size used by the @ref AbstractFont and
    @ref GlyphCacheGL should be chosen with respect to the actual physical
    pixels.

When using for example @ref Platform::Sdl2Application or other `*Application`
implementations, you usually have three values at your disposal ---
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::windowSize() "windowSize()",
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::framebufferSize() "framebufferSize()" and
@ref Platform::Sdl2Application::dpiScaling() "dpiScaling()". Their relation is
documented thoroughly in @ref Platform-Sdl2Application-dpi, for this particular
case a scaled interface size, used instead of window size for the projection,
would be calculated like this:

@snippet Text-gl.cpp BasicRenderer-dpi-interface-size

And a multiplier for the @ref AbstractFont and @ref GlyphCacheGL font size like
this. The @ref BasicRenderer "Renderer*D" keeps using the size without this
multiplier.

@section Text-BasicRenderer-required-opengl-functionality Required OpenGL functionality

Mutable text rendering requires @gl_extension{ARB,map_buffer_range} on desktop
OpenGL (also part of OpenGL ES 3.0). If @gl_extension{EXT,map_buffer_range} is not
available in ES 2.0, at least @gl_extension{OES,mapbuffer} must be supported for
asynchronous buffer updates. There is no similar extension in WebGL, thus plain
(and slow) buffer updates are used there.

@note This class is available only if Magnum is compiled with
    @ref MAGNUM_TARGET_GL enabled (done by default). See @ref building-features
    for more information.
